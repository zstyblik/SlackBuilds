# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

sshfs-fuse: 
sshfs-fuse: This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.
sshfs-fuse: Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy
sshfs-fuse: to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do.  On the
sshfs-fuse: client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the
sshfs-fuse: server with ssh.

sshfs-fuse: SSHFS *requires* FUSE!
