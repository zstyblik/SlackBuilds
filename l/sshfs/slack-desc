# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

sshfs: Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy

sshfs: client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into 
sshfs: the server with ssh.

sshfs: SSHFS *requires* FUSE!
