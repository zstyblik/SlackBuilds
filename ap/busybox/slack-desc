# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

busybox: BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities
busybox: into a single small executable. It provides replacements for most of
busybox: the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The
busybox: utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their
busybox: full-featured GNU cousins.
